Hello there! Bonjour!

I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Leicester. I am studying the variability of accreting black holes in X-rays observations but in other wavelengths. I currently focus on timing data from active galaxies and I am building tools to analyse astrophysical time series.

Previously, I was an undergraduate and master student at Universit√© Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier, in Toulouse, France. I did my master thesis on the X-ray variability of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7582.
